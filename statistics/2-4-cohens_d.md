[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

"2.4 Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups.  How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?"

```{python}
preg = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
live = preg[preg.outcome == 1]

first_wgtlb = live[live.pregordr == 1]['totalwgt_lb']
others_wgtlb = live[live.pregordr != 1]['totalwgt_lb']
# firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean(), others.totalwgt_lb.mean()
# Out: (7.201094430437772, 7.325855614973262)

def Cohen_D(group1, group2):
    mean1 = group1.mean()
    mean2 = group2.mean()
    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    size1 = len(group1)
    size2 = len(group2)
    
    d_num = mean1 - mean2
    d_den = np.sqrt((size1*var1 + size2*var2)/(size1 + size2))
    
    d = d_num/d_den
                                 
    return d
    
print(Cohen_D(first_wgtlb, others_wgtlb))
# Out: -0.088672927072602
```
The Cohen's effect size for weight is ~-0.0887, which is around 3x greater than the Cohen's d (0.0289) for pregnancy length. However, the effect size is still quite small, which means that the difference between the two means is less than 1/10 of standard deviation.
