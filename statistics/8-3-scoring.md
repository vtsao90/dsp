[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 3](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77)

"8.3: In games like hockey and soccer, the time between goals is roughly exponential. So you could estimate a team’s goal-scoring rate by observing the number of goals they score in a game. This estimation process is a little different from sampling the time between goals, so let’s see how it works.

Write a function that takes a goal-scoring rate, `lam`, in goals per game, and simulates a game by generating the time between goals until the total time exceeds 1 game, then returns the number of goals scored.

Write another function that simulates many games, stores the estimates of `lam`, then computes their mean error and RMSE.

Is this way of making an estimate biased?"
