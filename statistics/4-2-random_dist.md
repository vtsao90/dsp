[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

"4.2: The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?"

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

values = np.random.random(1000)
values.sort()
hist = {}
for value in values:
    hist[value] = hist.get(value,0) + 1

#PMF

pmf = {}
for k, v in hist.items():
    pmf[k] = v/len(hist)
    
pmf_sort = sorted(pmf.items())
x,y = zip(*pmf_sort)

plt.stem(x,y)
plt.show()
#Too much noise... 

#CDF

def CDF(values):
    values.sort()
    count = 0
    cdf = {}
    while count <= len(values) - 2:
        if values[count] != values[count + 1]:
            count += 1
            cdf[values[count - 1]] = count/len(values)
        else:
            count += 1
    count += 1
    cdf[values[count - 1]] = count/len(values)
    return cdf

cdf_vals = sorted(CDF(values).items())
x,y = zip(*cdf_vals)

plt.plot(x,y)
```

Yes, the distribution is uniform.
